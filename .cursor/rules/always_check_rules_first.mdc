# Always Check Rules First

Before answering any question or performing any task:

1. **Check available rules first**: Use `fetch_rules` to see what rules exist in the workspace
2. **Fetch relevant rules**: If you see rules related to your current task, fetch them immediately
3. **Apply rules before proceeding**: Follow any fetched rules before continuing with the task
4. **When in doubt, fetch**: If you're unsure whether a rule exists or applies, fetch it

**Common scenarios where rules are especially important:**
- **Testing**: Look for testing-related rules before running or writing tests
- **Code quality**: Check for coding standards, linting, or formatting rules
- **Database operations**: Look for database-related rules before migrations or queries
- **API development**: Check for API design or endpoint rules
- **File operations**: Look for file structure or naming convention rules

**How to check for rules:**
- Use `fetch_rules` with relevant rule names you see in the available rules list
- If you don't see specific rules, proceed with best practices
- Always prioritize workspace-specific rules over general assumptions

**Remember**: It's better to check and find no relevant rules than to assume and miss important guidelines.
